# Crown-clothing

Hello!

This is my first project with ReactJS , which I created based on ZTM course I'm currently pursuing. Therefore, in this project,
alongside with the instructors guide, I got familiar with React's features, lifecycle, it's methods and hooks, context API with useReducer hook for state 
management , concept of Redux's state managemet, styled components and the last but not least, DB-s such as GraphQL/ApolloClient and Firebase/Firestore (with authentication). I want to note that this project
just helped me to explore React's world and I did not master all of the mentioned technologies. However, I'm planning to shape my Front-End developing skills by
the upcoming projects, including those technologies.
